John was also sweating profusely after completing the matching game.

John also did well with the memorization game we played. We used 12 cards in a 3x4 grid.
He was able to find all matches in just 10 attempts, which is 3 better than he did last week.

John's confidence and body language definitely improved after his success during the memorization game,
especially after my positive verbal feedback.
He left the session with the same smile and calm demeanor that he came to the session with.
