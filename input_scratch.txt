John was also sweating profusely after completing the matching game.

John also did well with the memorization game we played. We used 12 cards in a 3x4 grid.
He was able to find all matches in just 10 attempts, which is 3 better than he did last week.

John's confidence and body language definitely improved after his success during the memorization game,
especially after my positive verbal feedback.
He left the session with the same smile and calm demeanor that he came to the session with.

John arrived at the session calm and greeted me with a smile.

"During the first activity (matching colors), John successfully matched 8 out of 10 colors with 80% accuracy.
He required minimal prompts (2 verbal prompts) to complete the task."

"Used visual aids for color matching."

"Reinforced correct matches with verbal praise and a small reward (sticker)."

"John exhibited signs of frustration (e.g., frowning, vocal protests) when he was unable to match two specific colors.
This behavior lasted approximately 2 minutes before he was able to refocus with support."

"For future session: Continue to use visual aids and consider introducing a timer to help John manage task completion."'
